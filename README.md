## Evaluation Procedure

Clone this repository, implement the evaluation requirements below.

To submit, zip up your solution's directiony while excluding the `node_modules` folder, and email the .zip file to <recruitment@kalibrilabs.com>.  (node_modules will result in the zip file being too large).

Take care to ensure all requirements are met and the application and its tests run without error.  

## Evaluation Requirements

Update the application so that when a user clicks an item in the display list, it removes that item via the repository service and updates the view to match.

Include unit tests to verify expected behavior, particularly within the, app component, display component, and repository service.  

## Environment Setup

### Install Node
This application requires Node 6.9.0 or higher, together with NPM 3 or higher (NPM gets installed by way of installing Node).
Instructions for all platforms are located here: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Install the latest Angular CLI  
After node is installed, install [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) (v 1.2.3+) by executing from a terminal:

## Running the application

From a terminal, switch to the application's directory and run `npm install` to install all dependencies in the `node_modules` folder.

When complete, run `ng serve` to start the application, and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to access it. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
